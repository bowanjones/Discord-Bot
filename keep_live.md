# Replit

üîÅ 1. Make Sure You Have a Web Server Running
In your project, you should have a keep_alive.py file like this:

python
Copy
Edit
from flask import Flask
from threading import Thread

app = Flask('')

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "I'm alive!"

def run():
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)

def keep_alive():
    t = Thread(target=run)
    t.start()
And in your stockbot2.py, you should call this at the top (before bot.run):

python
Copy
Edit
from keep_alive import keep_alive
keep_alive()
That makes your bot expose a simple webpage so UptimeRobot can ping it.

Click "Run" in Replit so the project starts

# Render
1. Prepare your bot project for deployment
Make sure your project has:

requirements.txt listing all dependencies (e.g., discord.py, flask if you use keep_alive)

Your main bot file, e.g., bot.py or stockbot2.py

Your bot token accessed via environment variable, e.g.:

python
Copy
Edit
import os

TOKEN = os.getenv("DISCORD_TOKEN")
bot.run(TOKEN)
2. Push your code to GitHub
Render connects to GitHub repos for deployment:

Create a GitHub repo if you don‚Äôt have one

Push your bot code and requirements.txt to this repo

3. Create a new service on Render
Go to https://render.com/ and sign up/log in

Click ‚ÄúNew‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúWeb Service‚Äù or ‚ÄúBackground Worker‚Äù (choose Background Worker for Discord bots)

Connect your GitHub account and select the repo with your bot code

4. Configure the service
Name: Give it a name, e.g. discord-bot

Environment: Choose Python 3

Build Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Command:
For example, if your main bot file is bot.py:

bash
Copy
Edit
python bot.py
Instance Type: Choose the free instance

Leave other settings default unless you want customizations

5. Set environment variables
In your service dashboard on Render, go to ‚ÄúEnvironment‚Äù tab

Add a new environment variable:

Key: DISCORD_TOKEN

Value: Your Discord bot token from Discord Developer Portal

6. Deploy
Click ‚ÄúCreate Web Service‚Äù or ‚ÄúCreate Background Worker‚Äù

Render will start building and deploying your bot

Logs will show build progress and your bot‚Äôs output

7. Confirm your bot is online
Look for your bot's on_ready message in the logs (you can add a print statement in your bot‚Äôs on_ready event)

Check your Discord server to see if the bot appears online
